Non-Blocking Server Apology
---------------------------

I put this example together at the last minute for the February FAQ.  It 
makes some bad assumptions you should be aware of.  It's now April, and 
still no fix, but I should get a short summer vacation.  Maybe I'll find 
time to fix it at the cottage.

I assume that all of the reads and writes I do are going to happen 
without blocking.  What I should really do is place not only the file 
descriptor for each socket in a cache, but also a pointer to a read and 
write buffer.  Then all reads and writes should check for things like
EWOULDBLOCK and less bytes transmitted than expected, and adjust the 
buffer accordingly.

Also, I didn't have time to run this by Andrew or others, and given the 
rush job...  well, don't be suprised if you find a few bugs.  I hope it 
is at least helpful as a start.

Good luck,
  Vic.
