Thanks to Andrew Gierth <ANDREWG@microlise.co.uk> for these examples.

Andrew wanted me to point out that the techniques in these examples will
make your code very difficult to port to non-unix platforms, such as
Windows, OS/2, etc. 

These files contain an example of line based socket use with stdio and the
smtp protocol.  The smtp_vrfy program is used this way:

  $ smtp_vrfy hostname.domain user1 [user2 user3...]

I had to remove the #include <sys/select.h> to compile it on my Linux system,
although this line should be left in for SVR4.2 systems, and probably others.

I also had to add #include <sys/param.h> which defines MAXHOSTNAMELEN.

  Vic.
