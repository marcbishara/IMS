Unix-socket-faq Sample Code 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
This code is used in the unix-socket-faq to illustrate concepts, etc.  It
is here to teach socket programming, and so if it does anything wrong, I
would like to hear about it.  You can email me at vic@brutus.tlug.org. 
The code was not written to teach c.  It was written to be readable.  If
you have suggestions for me, to make the code more readable or correct, I
would like to hear from you. 

Will it run on my system? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
It was developed under Linux 1.2.3 and gcc 2.6.3.  I have also built it on
SunOS 4.1.3 with their c compiler.  It has been reported to build on AIX, SCO,
DGUX and DEC OSF/1 cleanly and on DEC Ultrix with only "marginal trouble". 
I expect that since I have adjusted to compile on SunOS, it shouldn't
cause much trouble on other systems.  Let me know if you have problems on
your platform, and we'll see what we can do. 

The UDP Examples:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The UDP examples here illustrate a very simple protocol with no error checking.
I hope to provide a more complicated example, with error checking in a future
edition of the faq.  The problem is that there is no way for the client or
server to know whether or not the other received a message.  The protocol will
have to be extended to offer this sort of checking.

The current protocol is very simple.  A client sends an amount to the server,
the server adds that amount to its running total, and returns that total.

The TCP Examples:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The tcp examples illustrate an upper case echo server.  The server takes input,
separated by a line-feed, upper cases the input, and echos it to the client.
The client example reads lines of input until the users presses enter on an
empty line, at which time it closes the connection.
