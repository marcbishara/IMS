Since the issue of security has come up in c.u.p., I thought I'd create a 
subdirectory here with sample code for dealing with security issues.  I 
was interested in trying out the SO_REUSEADDR vulnerability, and I 
thought others might be interested too.  More will come if more topics 
to do with security issues come up.

This is not intended as a how-to for would be "hackers" (in the Hollywood 
sense of the word), but as a resource for programmers so that we can 
better protect our programs from attack.
